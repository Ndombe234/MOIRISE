# M13 — ADAPTIVE WORLD — CONCEPTION TECHNIQUE REPRISE À ZÉRO

## 1. AdaptiveDecision
{playerScope, candidateRefs[], filtersApplied[], noveltyBudget, diversityBudget, policyVersion, generatedAt, expiry}
Decision is reproducible from versioned policy and evidence refs.

## 2. Living Object
LivingObject {id, ownerId, currentVersion, permissions, lineageRef}. LivingObjectVersion is immutable. Branch/merge operations preserve attribution and source refs.

## 3. Convergence pipeline
signals → normalized trajectories → candidate pairs/groups → confidence → privacy filter → anti-manipulation → proposal.
No raw private content is required. Sensitive dimensions are excluded from the feature space.

## 4. Convergence Space
Scope includes participants/solo actor, experiment definition, visibility, expiry, outcome schema and policyVersion. Leaving a space revokes access but does not erase unrelated source objects.

## 5. World Memory
WorldMemoryCandidate = claim, sourceRefs, attribution, confidence, scope, retention, correctionPath, status. Retrieval returns bounded projections. Corrections create new versions rather than rewriting provenance.

## 6. Failure/recovery
Low confidence → reject/suppress. Source revoked → invalidate projection. M15 down → deterministic adaptive baseline. Provider down → local/cache path. Feedback burst → throttle.

## 7. Security
No sensitive trait inference. No hidden participant disclosure. Permission checks before convergence presentation. Memory retrieval always scope-filtered.

## 8. Observability
decisionId, policyVersion, filter outcomes, candidate counts, convergence confidence class, memory source refs. Do not log raw private messages.

## 9. Tests
Convergence false-positive prevention, privacy filtering, manipulation burst, revoked Living Object, stale memory, solo-only path, AI unavailable, mobile/desktop.

## 10. DONE
Adaptive behavior is contextual but bounded, explainable by permitted evidence, privacy-safe and reversible.

## AI MODULE CONTRACT — M13

AdaptiveSignal = { signalId, sourceModule, sourceRef, observedAt, evidenceHash, privacyClass, confidence, expiresAt }.
AdaptationProposal = { targetSurface, changeSet, evidenceRefs, reasonKey, confidence, policyClass, cooldownKey, expiresAt, rollbackRef }.
M13 validates evidence freshness, privacy, threshold, cooldown and target scope before commit.
Convergence/Emergence requires versioned threshold logic over real signals. Tests cover signal poisoning, fabricated event, privacy breach, oscillation, cooldown bypass, duplicate adaptation and rollback.

# D10 — M13 ADAPTIVE WORLD — CONCEPTION TECHNIQUE
## Signal
`AdaptiveSignal={signalId,sourceRef,sourceModule,scope,confidence,observedAt,expiryAt,evidenceRefs[]}`.
## Proposal
`AdaptiveProposal={proposalId,targetOwner,action,inputs,policyVersion,reasonKey,expiresAt,status}`.
## Pipeline
collect → scope → dedupe → normalize → decay → correlate → propose → owner validate → event → projection.
## World memory promotion
Observation must pass provenance/confidence/policy and scope checks. Promotion to broader scope is explicit.
## Convergence
Store only bounded feature references and evidence keys; avoid sensitive attribute inference.
## Tests
private signal leak, stale signal, duplicate proposal, oscillation, provider outage, owner rejection and rollback.

# D100 — TECHNICAL CONTRACT DETAIL
## AdaptiveSignal
AdaptiveSignal = signalId + sourceRef + sourceModule + scope + confidence + observedAt + expiresAt + evidenceRefs[] + policyVersion.
## AdaptiveProposal
AdaptiveProposal = proposalId + targetOwner + action + inputRefs[] + reasonKey + confidence + policyVersion + expiresAt + status.
## Pipeline
ingest → scope check → normalize → dedupe → decay → correlate → candidate → policy → owner validation → event → projection.
## Memory promotion
Scope widening stores source scope + target scope + justification + policy version + owner decision. Rejected candidates remain historical evidence only where retention permits.
## Tests
private signal promotion, stale signal, duplicate proposal, oscillation, low confidence, provider outage, owner rejection and rollback.
